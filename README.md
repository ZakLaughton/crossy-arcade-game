# Zak's Crossy Game

## Running
To run the game, open up index.html in any browser.

For live demo, see https://crossy.zaklaughton.com.

## Instructions

The object of the game is to move your player to the water. Each time you reach
the water, you gain a point. Careful of the bugs though! Every bug you hit will
cost you one life. Once you've lost 3 lives, the game is over and the game
resets.
